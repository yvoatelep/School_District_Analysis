# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

## Overview of Project
The goal of this analysis is to compare the average student performance of throughout the distric both with and without  Thomas High School 9th grade class, to better determine if cheating has taken place. The assumption would be that, if grades had been replaced with false grades for the THS 9th grade, then the averages without THS 9th grade would be lower than those with the 9th grade added

### Results
According to the original analysis, Thomas High School was one of the top performing schools in the district with Average math scores of 83.4, Average Reading scores of 83.9, and an Overall passing rate for both Reading and Math of 90.9%

When the Thomas High School 9th grade scores are removed and district analysis is recalculated, Thomas remaiins one of the top performing school.Average scores have changed only incrementally, with new Average math scores remaining 83.4, Average Reading scores still at 83.9, and an Overall passing rate for both Reading and Math of 90.6%

Because my challenge code did not run successfully, I am not able to esxamine the differences in execution time between the original and the refactored script. (Above images are from my original module work. I included these because they did run correctily and I could use them to analyze the stocks.) ) 

## Summary

At this time, I can't comment on the advantages of refactoring code because my refactored code did not run successfully, except to say that it is a learning experience and could well yield better results if done correctly. The disadvantage is that it is time consuming to change code that already works and it could be risky. 
It's wise to mitigate that risk by commenting your original code so that it can be preserved in case your new code does not run correctly. 

In my case, the original script was much more advantageous, simply because it was more straightforward and worked for me. I found the most interesting thing about the deliverable here was that it became interactive, so that the end user could make use of it again and again with new data sets and 
get clear, formatted results with the click of a button. If the refactored code works eventually, the code could be even more valuable to the user as more data could be added and more stocks could be analyzed.
