# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The goal of this analysis is to compare the average student performance of throughout the distric both with and without  Thomas High School 9th grade class, to better determine if cheating has taken place. The assumption would be that, if grades had been replaced with false grades for the THS 9th grade, then the averages without THS 9th grade would be lower than those with the 9th grade added

### Results
According to the original analysis, Thomas High School was one of the top performing schools in the district with Average math scores of 83.4, Average Reading scores of 83.9, and an Overall passing rate for both Reading and Math of 90.9%

When the Thomas High School 9th grade scores are removed and district analysis is recalculated, Thomas remaiins one of the top performing school.Average scores have changed only incrementally, with new Average math scores remaining 83.4, Average Reading scores still at 83.9, and an Overall passing rate for both Reading and Math of 90.6%

Similarly, the results of the analysis of schools by spending ranges per student do not change in any detectable way when the THS 9th grade scores are removed from the averages. In both, the range in which Thomas falls, $631-$645 per student, have an average Math Scocre of  78.5, average Reading Schore of 81.6 and an overall passing rate of 63%

## Summary

Looking at these figures with Thomas High School 9th grades included and removed, I would conclude that it is highly unlikely that cheating occurred. The scores that were acheived by this 9th grade class are simlilar to other classes at THS, and at other schools similar in size and budget. The statistics for these analysis do not change appreciably with the figures for the 9th grade removed, and I would conclubde that cheating was not a factor in these scores.
